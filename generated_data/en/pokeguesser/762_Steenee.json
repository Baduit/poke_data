        "The sepals on its head developed to protect its\nbody. These are quite hard, so even if pecked\nby bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine.",
        "This Pokémon is always bouncing around\nenergetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by\nits lively appearance and pleasant aroma.",
        "It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays\nwith bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it\nrelentlessly, but it doesn’t care.",
        "It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its\nhead with abandon. They’re quite painful when\nthey smack you!",
        "As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads\nout around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will\nfeel a surge of happiness.",
        "Any Corvisquire that pecks at this\nPokémon will be greeted with a smack from\nits sepals followed by a sharp kick."
