        "Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets\nangry and flails about, its arms and legs could\nknock a pro wrestler sprawling.",
        "A touch from anyone except a known friend\nsends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly\ndangerous Pokémon.",
        "It boasts power enough to split large trees in\nhalf. The organ on its rear releases an odor that\nit uses to communicate with others of its kind.",
        "Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any\nway. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with\namazing power.",
        "Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly\nreaching out to touch this Pokémon could result\nin painful retaliation.",
        "The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may\nbe an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is\nflailing that can snap thick tree trunks."
