        "It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for\nbeginners because of its friendliness, but its\ndisposition grows rougher as it grows up.",
        "This Pokémon has lived with people since times\nlong ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the\ndumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side.",
        "As they develop, their disposition grows more\nviolent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them\ntoo much to handle and abandon them.",
        "When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you,\nthat’s proof of its love for you. However, the\nrocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!",
        "This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its\nTrainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising\na Rockruff for a long time can be challenging.",
        "This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking\nthe ground with the rocks on its neck. The\nmoment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks."
