        "Uses anti-gravity\nto stay suspended.\nAppears without\fwarning and uses\nTHUNDER WAVE and\nsimilar moves.",
        "It is born with\nthe ability to\ndefy gravity. It\ffloats in air on\npowerful electro­\nmagnetic waves.",
        "It is attracted by\nelectromagnetic\nwaves. It may\fapproach trainers\nif they are using\ntheir POKéGEAR.",
        "The units at the\nsides of its body\ngenerate anti­\fgravity energy to\nkeep it aloft in\nthe air.",
        "The electricity\nemitted by the\nunits on each side\fof its body cause\nit to become a\nstrong magnet.",
        "MAGNEMITE attaches itself to power\nlines to feed on electricity.\nIf your house has a power outage,\fcheck your circuit breakers. You may\nfind a large number of this POKéMON\nclinging to the breaker box.",
        "MAGNEMITE floats in the air by emitting\nelectromagnetic waves from the units\nat its sides. These waves block gravity.\fThis POKéMON becomes incapable of\nflight if its internal electrical supply\nis depleted.",
        "The units at its sides are extremely\npowerful magnets. They generate enough\nmagnetism to draw in iron objects from\nover 300 feet away.",
        "It moves while constantly hovering.\nIt discharges THUNDER WAVE and so on\nfrom the units at its sides.",
        "Uses antigravity to stay suspended.\nAppears without warning and uses THUNDER\nWAVE and similar moves.",
        "The units at its sides generate\nelectromagnetic waves that keep it\nairborne. It feeds on electricity.",
        "The units at its sides generate\nelectromagnetic waves that keep it\nairborne. It feeds on electricity.",
        "The faster the units at its sides\nrotate, the greater the magnetic\nforce they generate.",
        "It is attracted by electromagnetic\nwaves. It may approach Trainers\nif they are using their Pokégear.",
        "The units at the sides of its body\ngenerate antigravity energy to\nkeep it aloft in the air.",

        "The faster the units at its sides\nrotate, the greater the magnetic\nforce they generate.",
        "The electromagnetic waves emitted by\nthe units at the sides of its head expel\nantigravity, which allows it to float.",
        "The electromagnetic waves emitted by\nthe units at the sides of its head expel\nantigravity, which allows it to float.",
        "The units at the sides of its body generate\nantigravity energy to keep it aloft in the air.",
        "It moves while constantly hovering. It discharges\nThunder Wave and so on from the units at its sides.",
        "It’s frequently the cause of power outages,\nwhich is why some power plants send out\nelectrical signals that it can’t stand.",
        "Magnemite attaches itself to power lines to feed on electricity.\nIf your house has a power outage, check your circuit breakers.\nYou may find a large number of this Pokémon clinging to the\nbreaker box.",
        "Magnemite floats in the air by emitting electromagnetic waves\nfrom the units at its sides. These waves block gravity. This\nPokémon becomes incapable of flight if its internal electrical\nsupply is depleted.",
        "They gather in places where electricity is\navailable. They can be found clinging to the\nsteel towers used to support power lines.",
        "It sends out electromagnetic waves, which let it\nfloat through the air. Touching it while it’s eating\nelectricity will give you a full-body shock.",
        "Perhaps because electrical lines are often\nburied these days, the number of Magnemite\nattacks on power plants has increased.",
        "It is hatched with the ability to defy gravity.\nIt floats while emitting powerful\nelectromagnetic waves.",
        "It is hatched with the ability to defy gravity.\nIt floats while emitting powerful\nelectromagnetic waves.",
        "At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and\nends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a\ngrounded Magnemite, it’ll start moving again.",
        "It subsists on electricity. As Magnemite flies, it\nemits electromagnetic waves from the units on\neach side of its body.",
        "A bizarre Pokémon with but a single eye embedded in an iron\nsphere. I suspect this creature levitates due to the magnetism it\nemits from its arms, which resemble horseshoe-shaped magnets."
