        "This wary Pokémon uses photosynthesis to\nstore up energy during the day, while becoming\nactive at night.",
        "Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before\nthey even notice it, it begins to pelt them with\nvicious kicks.",
        "It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as\nblades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong,\nso its kicks are also formidable.",
        "It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has\nbeen known to use its Trainer’s pocket or bag\nas a nest.",
        "At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while\nflying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet\nswitches tactics and delivers vicious kicks.",
        "During the day, it builds up energy via\nphotosynthesis. At night, it flies silently\nthrough the sky, on the prowl for prey.",
        "Flies noiselessly on delicate wings. It has mastered the art of\ndeftly launching dagger-sharp feathers from those same wings."
