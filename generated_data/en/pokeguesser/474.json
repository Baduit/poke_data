        "In order to create a more advanced Pokémon, an\nadditional program was installed, but apparently\nit contained a defect that makes it move oddly.",
        "Its program was modified to facilitate\nextra-dimensional activities, but that led to\nnoticeably strange behavior.",

        "A faulty update was added to its programming.\nIts behavior is noticeably strange, so the\nexperiment may have been a failure.",
        "Porygon-Z had a program installed to allow it to\nmove between dimensions, but the program also\ncaused instability in Porygon-Z’s behavior.",
        "Some say an additional program made this\nPokémon evolve, but even academics can’t agree\non whether Porygon-Z is really an evolution.",
        "A curious item induced this evolution. The Pokémon's offensive\ncapabilities have greatly increased, but the strangeness of its\nbehavior has magnified in equal measure. This worries me."
