        "A bit of a dandy, it spends its free time\npreening its wings. Its preoccupation with any\ndirt on its plumage can leave it unable to battle.",
        "It throws sharp feathers called blade quills\nat enemies or prey. It seldom misses.",
        "This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak.\nIf you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop\nlistening to you.",
        "Supremely sensitive to the presence of others,\nit can detect opponents standing behind it,\nflinging its sharp feathers to take them out.",
        "It throws one knifelike feather after another at its\nenemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak\npoint. These feathers are known as blade quills.",
        "It never slacks when it comes to the task of\ncleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it\nlooking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.",
        "Regularly basks in sunlight to gather power—presumably due to\nthe frigid climate. Nonetheless, the edges of the blade quills set\ninto its wings are keen as ever."
