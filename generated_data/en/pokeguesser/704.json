        "The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon,\nit’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out,\nso it sticks to shady places.",
        "Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden\nmucous membrane. Anyone who touches it\nneeds some thorough hand-washing.",
        "It uses its horns to check out its surroundings.\nThey’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it\nwill feel a strong shock and be unable to move.",
        "Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will\ndie, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness\nin the shade.",
        "Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if\nthe weather becomes too arid. It’s considered\nthe weakest dragon Pokémon.",
        "Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as\nGoomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into\nhiding. This is how they’ve survived.",
        "Goomy hides away in the shade of trees, where it's nice and\nhumid. If the slime coating its body dries out, the Pokémon\ninstantly becomes lethargic."
