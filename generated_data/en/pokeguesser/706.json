        "It attacks with retractable horns.\nIt throws a punch that’s the equivalent\nof the force of a hundred pro boxers.",
        "An amazingly friendly Pokémon, but if left to\nitself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes\ngooey tears.",
        "It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then,\nwhoever teased it gets to feel the full force of\nits horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.",
        "It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow\nclose to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky,\nslime-covered body. Don’t get mad.",
        "Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat,\nand the combination of the two makes enemies’\nattacks slide right off.",
        "Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and\nappears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers\ndon’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable.",
        "Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its\nhorns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any\nblow from a heavyweight boxer.",
        "Able to freely control the hardness of its metallic shell.\nIt loathes solitude and is extremely clingy—it will fume and\nrun riot if those dearest to it ever leave its side."
