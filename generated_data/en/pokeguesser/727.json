        "This Pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition.\nIf it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its\nTrainer’s orders with complete nonchalance.",
        "After hurling ferocious punches and flinging\nfurious kicks, it finishes opponents off by\nspewing fire from around its navel.",
        "Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it\nfinds beating down unworthy opponents boring.\nIt gets motivated for stronger opponents.",
        "When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames\naround its waist become especially intense.",
        "It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles.\nThe temperature of the flames that issue from its\nnavel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its\nmost notable trait, but the way it helps out small\nPokémon shows that it has a kind side as well."
