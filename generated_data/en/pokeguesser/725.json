        "While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its\nstomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery\nattacks, which change based on how it coughs.",
        "It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen.\nEarning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude.",
        "If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t\nopen up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving\nit too much affection is still a no-no.",
        "Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time\ncomes, Litten sets its own body on fire and\nburns away the old fur.",
        "It spends even the smallest amount of downtime\ngrooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers\nin its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.",
        "Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will\nresult in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws.\nBe careful."
