        "Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and\nslurp out the sap. It normally lives underground.",
        "They often gather near places frequented by\nelectric Pokémon in order to avoid being\nattacked by bird Pokémon.",
        "If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your\nhand inside. You’ll get bitten by an\nirritated Grubbin.",
        "It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in\ntheir tracks, and then it grabs them in its\nsharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down.",
        "Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may\nflee rather than risk getting caught in its large\nmandibles that can snap thick tree branches.",
        "It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest\nfloor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap."
