        "Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its\n12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits\nscattered in its wake.",
        "Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer\nintense pain for three days and three nights.\nPost-recovery, there will be some aftereffects.",
        "To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes\nflying at its enemies. Ones that come close get\nmown down by the claws on its feet.",
        "With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter\nwithin. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect\nToxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable.",
        "To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this\nPokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing\nits body so it can capture its own body heat.",
        "Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so\ntoxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still\nbe suffering three days after it first takes effect."
