        "Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to\nenter at night. People confused by its strange\nlights can never find their way home again.",

        "It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their\nvitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its\nkind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality.",
        "When it starts fighting for territory with\nParasect, the entire area gets completely\ncoated in spores!",
        "Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to\nsleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing,\nit drains their vitality with its fingertips.",
        "If you see a light deep in a forest at night,\ndon’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall\nfast asleep."
