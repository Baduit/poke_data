        "It spits a mud that provides resistance to both\nwind and rain, so the walls of old houses were\noften coated with it.",
        "Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best\nmeans of attack, and it can reduce large trucks\nto scrap without breaking a sweat.",
        "It remains calm and unmoving no matter the\nsituation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its\nmouth to make a special kind of mud.",
        "It can trudge mountain roads without rest\nfor three days and three nights, all the while\ndragging a 10-ton load.",
        "Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs\nsets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows\nthis Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick.",
        "Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry\nover 10 tons across the Galar region without rest\nor sleep."
