        "It plunges the poison spike on its head into its\nprey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie\ndeals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.",
        "It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors.\nThe coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as\ngood as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.",
        "They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are\nhated by craftsmen who work with Corsola\nbranches that have naturally fallen off.",
        "Aside from its head, its body parts\nregenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a\ngood night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal.",
        "The first symptom of its sting is numbness.\nThe next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s\nimpossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.",
        "Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie\nof the Galar region have not yet figured out\nthat the branches of Corsola are delicious."
